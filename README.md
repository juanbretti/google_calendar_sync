# google_calendar_sync
Sync two **Google Calendar** using the *API* and *Python*.

I had created this *Python* app, because when you import event, guests and conference data for that event are not imported ([Reference](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37118)).

## Create Google Calendar API private keys
To start syncing with Google Calendar, youâ€™ll need to collect the Client ID and Client Secret from your Google API.\
Follow this [tutorial](https://simplyscheduleappointments.com/guides/google-api-credentials/).
